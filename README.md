# Maze

Implementation of the Maze project.

## Introduction

In this project youâ€™ll learn about mazes and caves, including the basic algorithms of their handling, such as: generation, rendering, solving.


## Chapter II

## Information

A maze with "thin walls" is a table of _n_ rows by _m_ columns size. There may be "walls" between the cells of a table. The table as a whole is also surrounded by "walls".

The following is an example of such a maze: \

The solution to a maze is the shortest path from a given starting point (table cell) to the ending one.

When traversing a maze, you can move to neighboring cells that are not separated by a "wall" from the current cell and that are on the top, bottom, right or left.
A route is considered the shortest if it passes through the smallest number of cells.

An example of a maze with its solution:  \

In this example, the starting point is 10; 1, and the ending point is 6; 10.
